[Attach QR code here]

## Launch date
Monday 22nd April 2019

## End date
Wednesday 31st July 2019

## Progress tracking 
Everyday, we’ll post a summary of everyone who made at least 1 Github post by midnight China time (GMT + 8) (hopefully this can be automated)

Optional:
If a person doesn’t make a commit for 7 (or x) days in a row, we kick them out of the group.
You can message us if you need a break and want to stay in the chat
Use the rules from the 7 app
- Skip up to 3 days out of 20 days. 3 trials are replenished every 20 days

We need to design the report

### Daily
- List of people who made a commit (and weekly streak)

### Weekly
- How many commits per person(?)
- Summary of commits from beginning
- # of people who dropped
- # of lines of code added
- Highlight someone’s code (if we have time) (occasionally)
- Leaderboard
- Pie chart?
- Breakdown of language - pie chart

## Pre-launch requirements / Onboarding (Send out on Thursday)
- Provide your Github username
- Post an introduction in the group, with the following
	- What you’re working on
	- What you might need help on in the future
- Github training?
- Explain all of these rules / thinking

## Question
* Should this include weekends? Yes

## Other ideas
* Prize for most days in a row?
* Everyone pitches in 10 RMB, and prize pool goes to top 3?
* Weekly streaks - keep track of who has the highest streak of commits every 7 days (Instead of highest streak out of 100…since there might just be 1 winner, and everyone else gets discouraged.)
* Reminder update (hopefully automated) @ 8pm - checking who hasn’t posted yet
