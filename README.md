# Coderbunker x 100daysofcode
Welcome to our Coderbunker x 100 Days of Code challenge!

## Objective

## Suggested Dates
Monday 22nd April 2019 to Wednesday 31st July 2019

## How this works
* Continuously code every day for at least 30 minutes for 100 days
* Save your code updates to Github through commits everyday by midnight China time (GMT + 8)
* We'll track everybody's Github commits through their username everyday
* Grace days - sometimes you need a break. Every week, you get 1 free day to skip. These free days do not roll over to the next day
* At the end of our challenge (31st July 2019), whoever has the most "consistent" track record will get a prize!

### How do I use Github?
Great question. There's a lot of great resources and tutorials out there to learn how to use Github.
One of the better ones comes from Github labs:
https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github
Please feel free to try it out to get yourself familiar with this tool!

Ultimately, you'll probably want to integrate Github with the coding editor that you're using.
For example, if you're using VS Code, you can follow this tutorial to quickly sync your code changes to Github:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

## Requirements
* Make sure know how to make a commit to Github. That is how we'll track your daily progress
* Add your github username to the Github accounts.md file
* Post an introduction in the group, with the following
	* What you’re working on
	* What you might need help on in the future

## Some ideas for tracking:
### Daily
- List of people who made a commit (and weekly streak)

### Weekly
- How many commits per person(?)
- Summary of commits from beginning
- # of people who dropped
- # of lines of code added
- Highlight someone’s code (if we have time) (occasionally)
- Leaderboard
- Pie chart?
- Breakdown of language - pie chart

## Other ideas we're still debating
* Prize for most days in a row?
* Everyone pitches in 10 RMB, and prize pool goes to top 3?
* Weekly streaks - keep track of who has the highest streak of commits every 7 days (Instead of highest streak out of 100…since there might just be 1 winner, and everyone else gets discouraged.)
* Reminder update (hopefully automated) @ 8pm - checking who hasn’t posted yet
