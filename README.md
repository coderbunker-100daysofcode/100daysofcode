## Challenge dates
Monday 22nd April 2019 to Wednesday 31st July 2019

## How this works
* Code every day for 100 days
* Commit your code to Github everyday by midnight China time (GMT + 8)
* We'll track everybody's Github commits through their username everyday
* Grace days - sometimes you need a break. Every week, you get 1 free day to skip. These free days do not roll over to the next day
* At the end of our challenge (31st July 2019), whoever has the most "consistent" will be congratulated with plenty of praise and pats on the back!

### So...how do I "commit" to Github?
Great question. There's a lot of great resources and tutorials out there to learn how to use Github.
One of the better ones comes from Github labs:
https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github
Please feel free to try it out to get yourself familiar with this tool!

We'll also be holding trainings as needed.

Ultimately, you'll probably want to integrate Github with the coding editor that you're using.
For example, if you're using VS Code, you can follow this tutorial to quickly sync your code changes to Github:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

## Requirements before starting
* Learn how to make a commit to Github. That is how we'll track your daily progress
* Share your Github username with the WeChat group, so we can add your name to the tracker
* Post an introduction in the group, with the following
	* What youâ€™re working on
	* What you might need help on in the future

## Run the tracker
Requirements:
- dotenv (with conda: conda install -c conda-forge python-dotenv)
- pandas
- matplotlib

To overcome the GitHub API rate limit without authentication (50 requests / hour), create a personal access token from your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens): click on 'generate new token'. Copy the token into an .env file:
TOKEN=your_new_token
USER=your_github_username
Do not commit this .env file to github. Protect your token as you would protect a password.

You can run the code through the terminal using the command:
python Github_scrap_for_reports.py --participants username1 username2 --weekly 1 --daily 1
All arguments are optional. But if you don't specify either weekly or daily no report will be generated.
Instead of entering the list of participants through the command line, you can greate a github_account.txt file containing github usernames + real names (or wechat usernames) as follows:
github_username1, wechat_username1
github_username2, wechat_username2
